[0-3s] HOOK:
"Okay, before I do something dumb on Robinhood..."

But—I've learned my lesson. Let me check Bloom AI first."

Yeah... no. Not doing that."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

VISUALS:

- Finger hovering creates tension and anticipation
- Frame 2: Show actual thought process with text overlays (inner monologue)
- Quick app switch animation (Robinhood → Bloom AI)
- Frame 3: Real Bloom AI analysis loading and displaying results
- Emphasis on red warning indicators
- Frame 4: Return to Robinhood, finger moves away (relief moment)
- All screen recordings must be real, unedited apps

MUSIC:
- Suspenseful tension (0-3s) - "am I really about to do this?"
- Building anxiety (3-12s) - FOMO pressure mounting
- Alert/warning sound effect (12s) when Bloom reveals data
- Relief/exhale sound (23s) - "dodged a bullet"
- Confident, protective outro (23-30s)

TEXT STYLE:
- "Before I do something dumb" in casual, handwritten font (relatable, self-aware)
- "Up 40%" in bright green (attractive, tempting)
- "FOMO is real" in orange/yellow (anxiety color)
- "SELL rating" in bold red with warning symbol (⚠️)
- "Overvalued by 65%" in red with emphasis
- "Yeah... no." in plain text (deadpan, matter-of-fact)
- "Crisis averted ✓" with green checkmark (relief payoff)

AUTHENTICITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Use REAL stock that's actually showing big gains and social media buzz
- Show actual Robinhood interface (not mockup)
- Use genuine Bloom AI analysis (not fabricated)
- Verify the stock IS actually showing concerning signals on Bloom
- Time-stamp the video to show it's current market data
- If claiming "insider selling spiked," show the actual data point

TONE CALIBRATION:
- **Self-deprecating**: "Before I do something dumb" (not "before YOU")
- **Relatable**: Everyone's felt FOMO on a running stock
- **Conversational**: Like talking to a friend, not preaching
- **Humble**: "I've learned my lesson" (admits past mistakes)
- **Protective but not preachy**: Showing, not telling
- **Humor**: "Yeah... no." (deadpan reaction to bad idea)

ENGAGEMENT DRIVERS:
1. **Instant Relatability**: Every retail trader has felt this exact moment
2. **Self-Aware Humor**: Admitting "dumb" disarms resistance
3. **Real-Time Decision**: Viewers watch the thought process unfold
4. **FOMO Validation**: Acknowledges the feeling is real and strong
5. **Practical Habit**: Shows exact workflow to prevent mistakes
6. **Relief Payoff**: "Crisis averted" feels satisfying

VARIATIONS TO TEST:

1. **Hook variations**:
   - "Okay, before I do something dumb on Robinhood..." (current)
   - "I almost just bought this—then I checked Bloom AI"
   - "FOMO almost got me again, but..."
   - "Wait, let me check something before I hit buy..."
   - "My finger's on the buy button but something feels off..."

2. **Platform variations**:
   - "Before I do something dumb on Robinhood..." (current)
   - "Before I YOLO this on Webull..."
   - "Before I ape into this on E*TRADE..."
   - "Before I FOMO into this..."

3. **Stock scenario variations**:
   - Up 40% in one day (current - hype-driven)
   - Down 30% (catching falling knife)
   - Trending on WSB (meme stock)
   - After earnings beat (appears good but overvalued)
   - Celebrity mentions it (Elon tweet, etc.)

4. **Reveal intensity variations**:
   - **Mild warning**: "Hold rating, slightly overvalued"
   - **Medium warning**: "Sell rating, overvalued by 65%" (current)
   - **Severe warning**: "Strong Sell, multiple red flags, P/E ratio of 400"

5. **Outcome variations**:
   - Saves from bad buy (current)
   - Confirms a good buy ("Actually looks solid")
   - Mixed signals ("Risky but could work—smaller position")

CONTROVERSY LEVEL: LOW-MEDIUM
- Self-deprecating humor = less controversial
- Specific stock callout = some controversy from bag-holders
- Not attacking others, just showing personal process
- Risk: If called-out stock rallies, "you were wrong"
- Mitigation: Focus on valuation risk, not price prediction

FOLLOW-UP CONTENT IDEAS:
1. "I didn't listen to Bloom AI once—here's what happened" (accountability)
2. "Stocks Bloom saved me from buying (that crashed)" (vindication)
3. "The time Bloom said 'BUY' and I was too scared" (counterbalance)
4. "My worst Robinhood impulse buys (before Bloom AI)" (story series)
5. "Teaching myself discipline: Check Bloom before every trade"
6. "30 days of checking Bloom first: Results"
7. "Responding to: 'Just trust your gut bro'" (educational)
8. "The trades I DIDN'T make (and how much I saved)"

CTA OPTIMIZATION:

**Primary CTA**: "Check Bloom AI before every trade. Every time. Link in bio."
- Specific action: "before every trade"
- Emphasis: "Every time" (habit formation)
- Urgency: Implied (protect yourself now)

**Secondary CTAs** (pinned comment):
- "What stock are you tempted to FOMO into right now? I'll check it on Bloom"
- "Drop the ticker you almost bought today 👇"
- "Anyone else use Bloom as their 'sanity check'?"

**Engagement Bait**:
- "Comment if FOMO has ever cost you money 💸"
- "What's your biggest impulse buy regret?"
- "Am I the only one who needs to be saved from myself? 😅"

POSTING STRATEGY:

**Timing**:
- **Optimal**: During market hours when a stock is actually surging (ride the trend)
- **Alternative**: After market close on a volatile day
- **Strategic**: Within 1-2 hours of a stock making major moves (maximum relevance)

- **TikTok**: Faster pacing, more dramatic suspense, trending sounds
- **Instagram Reels**: Cleaner UI, slightly more polished

3. "Before I YOLO my rent money..." (position sizing)
4. "Before I buy on margin..." (leverage risks)
5. "Before I sell the winner and keep the loser..." (disposition effect)
6. "Before I average down on a falling stock..." (catching knives)
7. "Before I buy because Elon tweeted..." (celebrity influence)

**Long-Form Content Ideas**:
- 30-day challenge: "I checked Bloom before every trade"
- Compilation: "10 times Bloom saved me from bad trades"
- Year in review: "Calculating what Bloom saved me in 2024"

AUTHENTICITY & CREDIBILITY SAFEGUARDS:

**Real-Time Evidence**:
- Must use actual stock that's surging TODAY
- Show actual Robinhood balance (can blur amounts)
- Use genuine Bloom AI analysis (not edited screenshots)
- Timestamp visible in video to prove current data
- Don't fabricate "overvalued by 65%" claim—use real metric

**Self-Awareness Calibration**:
- Own the impulse: "I'm tempted" not "You're all dumb"
- Vulnerability: "I've learned my lesson" (implies past failures)
- Humor: Self-deprecating, not mocking others
- Respect: Not shaming people who FOMO (acknowledging it's hard)

**Outcome Honesty**:
- If stock rallies after you pass: Post follow-up explaining valuation vs price
- If stock crashes after you pass: Don't gloat, educate
- If Bloom says "BUY" and you miss gains: Show that too (intellectual honesty)
- Track long-term: Did the saved trades pan out?

**Response Protocol**:
- "You missed the gains!" → "Valuation risk vs short-term price movement"
- "Just YOLO it!" → "I've learned that costs me money"
- "This is why you're poor" → Don't engage (ignore trolls)
- "What if Bloom is wrong?" → "It's one input, I still decide, but data > emotions"

**Legal/Ethical**:
- Never coordinate "everyone check Bloom and don't buy X" (manipulation)
- Disclose if compensated by Bloom AI
- Include disclaimer: "Not financial advice, my personal process"
- Don't encourage others to FOMO or panic: show discipline

TESTING FRAMEWORK:

**A/B Test Priorities**:
1. Platform mentioned: Robinhood vs Webull vs "before I FOMO"
2. Stock scenario: Up 40% vs Down 30% vs Meme trending
3. Outcome: Saved from loss vs Confirmed good buy
4. Hook tone: Self-deprecating vs Urgent warning

**Success Metrics**:
- 3-second hold rate (hook relatability)
- Completion rate (story satisfaction)
- Comments sharing FOMO experiences (engagement depth)
- "Drop a ticker" comment responses (practical application)
- Link clicks (CTA effectiveness)
- Shares to friends (habit-building value)

**Iteration Strategy**:
- Version 1: Current format (20-30s, single stock)
- Version 2: Shorter (10-15s, just the hook and reveal)
- Version 3: Comparison (2 stocks side-by-side, one good one bad)
- Version 4: Series format (weekly "Before I do something dumb" check-ins)
- Version 5: Extended (45-60s, deeper dive into why metrics matter)

**Platform Optimization**:
- TikTok: Fastest cuts, trending audio, more dramatic
- Instagram: Cleaner aesthetic, aspirational angle
- YouTube: Educational tone, explain the metrics
- Twitter: Screenshot thread format with real-time reactions
