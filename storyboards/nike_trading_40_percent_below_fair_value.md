TEXT OVERLAYS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
→ "Nike: $115B brand trading like a struggling startup"
→ "$175 → $75 (-57%). Fair value: $125. 67% upside."
→ "China slowdown + inventory mess + CEO mistakes = temporary pain"
→ "Brand intact. Issues fixable. Value play for patient capital."

SCRIPT / VOICEOVER:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[0-3s] HOOK:
"Nike is a 115 billion dollar brand. The swoosh is everywhere. But the stock
is trading at 75 dollars. Bloom AI says fair value is 125. That's a 40% discount.
Here's why."

[3-20s] THE DROP:
"Nike peaked at 175 dollars in November 2021. Today: 75 dollars. That's a 57%
drop. What happened? Three things: China sales collapsed. Margins got crushed
by inventory issues. And competitors like On and Adidas took market share.
The market panicked and sold. But is the brand actually broken, or is Nike
just having a bad year?"

[20-45s] THE ANALYSIS:
"Reason one: China slowdown. Revenue down 10% year-over-year. But Nike is still
the number one athletic brand globally. Reason two: Inventory mess. Too much
old stock, margins squeezed. But they're clearing it out now. Reason three:
New CEO mistakes. Tried to go direct-to-consumer too fast, alienated retailers.
But they're reversing course. These are all temporary, fixable problems."

[45-60s] THE VERDICT:
"Bloom AI verdict: Current price 75, fair value 125, 67% upside. Why now?
Stock is beaten down. Brand is still strong. They're fixing the issues. But
this requires patient capital. Risks: China doesn't recover, competitors win
more share, recovery takes longer. This isn't a flip. It's a 2-year hold.

• Acknowledge legitimate risks
• Not financial advice disclaimer

CONTROVERSY LEVEL: LOW (Data-driven value analysis)

BLUE-CHIP ANGLE:

• Brand strength vs stock weakness
• "How can this be so cheap?" curiosity

- Starbucks (China weakness, union issues)

- Walgreens (retail pharmacy challenged)

ENGAGEMENT BAIT:

SERIES POTENTIAL: VERY HIGH
**"Undervalued Blue-Chips" Series:**
- Nike (this one)
- Starbucks: $80 stock in a $120 brand
- Disney: Why the Mouse is on sale
- Target: Red tag on the stock itself
- Boeing: Fallen giant or value trap?
- Walgreens: Pharmacy in trouble or turnaround?

INVESTMENT THESIS ELEMENTS:
**Bull Case:**
- Brand strength intact (everyone knows Nike)
- Temporary operational issues (inventory clearing)
- CEO course correction (back to retailers)
- China recovery potential (when economy improves)
- Long-term growth trajectory unchanged
- Innovation pipeline (new products coming)

**Bear Case:**
- Structural China decline (not cyclical)
- Permanent market share loss (On, Hoka winning)
- Brand perception issues (loss of cool factor)
- Margin pressure permanent (competition)
- Longer recovery than expected (2-3 years)
- Management execution risk

DIFFERENTIATION FROM EXISTING CONTENT:
• Focus on household brands (more relatable)
• Value investing angle (not growth/momentum)
• Longer time horizon (2-year hold vs quick flip)
• Risk-reward balance (not just hype)
• Blue-chip safety (vs speculative plays)

VIRAL POTENTIAL: HIGH
• Everyone knows Nike (high recognition)
• Counterintuitive (great brand, bad stock)
• Clear value proposition (40% discount)
• Debate-worthy (is it a value or trap?)
• Actionable (can actually buy Nike stock)
• Educational (how to value blue-chips)
