TEXT OVERLAYS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
→ "Um guys, if you're buying stocks based on Reddit..."
→ "Just listen to me for 30 seconds"
→ "The post with 🚀🚀🚀 is NOT research"
→ "Check this BEFORE you buy"

[0-3s] HOOK:
"Um guys, if you're buying stocks based on Reddit posts, just... just listen to me."

[3-20s] SETUP (Protective Warning):
"I know the 'DD' looks convincing. I know there are rocket emojis. I know 47 people
said 'this is the way.' But that post was written by someone who bought at $3 and
needs YOU to buy at $15 so they can sell. That's not research. That's a pump."

[20-40s] REVEAL (Solution):
"Before you buy ANYTHING someone hyped on Reddit, run it through actual analysis.
Bloom AI will show you in 10 seconds if the stock is overvalued, if insiders are
dumping shares, if earnings are declining. The stuff the Reddit post conveniently
left out. It's saved me from so many bag-holding situations."

[40-50s] RESULTS + CTA:
"I'm not saying never use Reddit. I'm saying verify FIRST. Check the link in my bio
before you become exit liquidity for someone else's trade."

PRODUCTION NOTES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

VISUALS:
- Frame 1: Concerned friend intervention energy, not preachy or judgmental
- Frame 2: Real WallStreetBets post with typical "DD" format, rocket emojis, awards
- Frame 3: Split screen showing Reddit hype vs Bloom AI analysis with red flags
- Frame 4: Protective "I'm looking out for you" expression

MUSIC:
- [0-3s] Urgent but caring tone (not aggressive)
- [3-20s] Tension building (showing the risk)
- [20-40s] Shift to reassuring/protective
- [40-50s] Supportive resolution

TEXT STYLE:
- "Um guys" in lowercase (casual, friend-to-friend)
- Use of "just listen to me" (protective, not bossy)
- Emphasis on "BEFORE" (timing is critical)
- Quote marks around "DD" (subtle skepticism)

VARIATIONS TO TEST:
1. "Um guys, if you're buying stocks based on Reddit, just listen to me..." (current)
2. "Um guys, if you're following TikTok stock tips, just listen to me..."
3. "Um guys, if you're buying what YouTubers shill, just listen to me..."
4. "Um guys, if you're trusting anonymous internet strangers, just listen to me..."
5. Different platforms: Reddit vs Twitter vs Discord vs TikTok

CONTROVERSY LEVEL: MEDIUM-HIGH
- Direct criticism of Reddit stock culture (WallStreetBets community may react)
- "Exit liquidity" language is confrontational but accurate
- Will trigger defensive comments from WSB users (engagement boost)
- May get pushback: "Reddit DDs have made me money!" (be ready to respond)

ENGAGEMENT BAIT:
- Pin comment: "WSB veterans, am I wrong? 👀"
- "Drop the worst Reddit stock tip you ever followed"
- "How many of you are down on a Reddit play right now? 💀"
- Reply with: "I'm not anti-Reddit, I'm pro-verification"

CTA:
"Check the link in my bio before you become exit liquidity" (protective + specific consequence)

POSTING STRATEGY:
- **Best timing**: After major Reddit-hyped stock crashes (e.g., post-meme stock dump)
- **Trigger event**: When WSB stock-of-the-week tanks 40% in a day
- **Hashtags**: #WallStreetBets #RedditStocks #Investing #StockMarket #BloomAI
- **Platform**: TikTok primary (younger retail investor audience)
- **Series potential**: "Checking Reddit's top plays with Bloom AI" (weekly series)

FOLLOW-UP CONTENT IDEAS:
1. "I ran the top 5 WSB stocks through Bloom AI. Here's what I found."
2. "This Reddit DD had 10K upvotes. It missed these 3 red flags."
3. "How to spot a pump and dump on Reddit before you buy"
4. "Reddit vs hedge funds: who's actually winning?" (spoiler: neither, you need data)
5. "The ONE thing Reddit gets right about investing" (contrarian take for balance)
6. Response to comments: "Okay fine, here's a Reddit play that actually checked out"

WHY THIS HOOK WORKS:
- **Urgent intervention format**: "Um guys" = friend stopping you from making a mistake
- **Protective framing**: Not judging, protecting (builds trust)
- **Relatable behavior**: Everyone's checked Reddit for stock tips at some point
- **Call-out culture**: Light confrontation = engagement (defensive + supportive comments)
- **FOMO reversal**: Not "you're missing out", but "you're being used as exit liquidity"
- **Time-sensitive**: "BEFORE you buy" implies immediate danger
- **Authority positioning**: "Just listen to me" (I've been there, learned the hard way)
- **Contrast setup**: Hype vs actual analysis = clear value proposition
