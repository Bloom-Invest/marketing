[0-3s] HOOK:
"I just panic-sold at a 30% loss, and THEN I find out about this???"

[3-15s] SETUP (Relatable Pain):
"So I bought this stock three weeks ago. It looked great. Revenue was growing,
everyone on Twitter was bullish, the chart looked clean. Two weeks later I'm down
30% and I panic sold because I couldn't handle watching it drop anymore. $2,400 gone."

[15-30s] REVEAL (Discovery):
"And THEN—literally yesterday—someone sends me Bloom AI. I put in the same ticker,
and it IMMEDIATELY shows me a risk score of 73/100. High volatility warning.
Insider selling. Valuation concerns. ALL the stuff I missed. This information
existed BEFORE I bought. I just didn't check."

[30-40s] RESULTS + CTA:
"I'm genuinely upset I didn't know about this three weeks ago. If you're about to
buy ANYTHING, check this first. Link in bio. Don't be me."

PRODUCTION NOTES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

VISUALS:
- Frame 1: Genuine frustration/regret expression (not over-acted)
- Frame 2: Real portfolio screenshot showing -30.2% loss and panic sell timestamp
- Frame 3: Bloom AI showing the SAME stock with clear red flags and risk score
- Frame 4: "I can't believe this existed the whole time" disbelief

MUSIC:
- [0-3s] Frustrated/defeated sound (sigh or "ugh")
- [3-15s] Somber, reflective (recounting the mistake)
- [15-30s] Rising "wait, what??" realization energy
- [30-40s] Resolved but still frustrated

TEXT STYLE:
- "JUST" in all caps (emphasis on timing irony)
- Triple question marks (???) for maximum disbelief
- "I'm sick" (Gen Z expression of frustration/regret)
- Specific number: 30% loss (credibility)

VARIATIONS TO TEST:
1. "One panic sell at a 30% loss and I just found this???" (current)
2. "One bag-holding position and I just found this???"
3. "One terrible earnings call and I just found this???"
4. "One margin call and I just found this???"
5. Different loss amounts: $2,400 vs $5,000 vs $10,000
6. Different timeframes: 3 weeks vs 6 months vs 1 year

CONTROVERSY LEVEL: LOW
- Vulnerability creates empathy, not conflict
- Self-deprecating (I was the idiot)
- No attacks on other tools or people
- Shared pain point = supportive comments

ENGAGEMENT BAIT:
- Pin comment: "What's your worst panic sell? I'll go first: -$2,400"
- "Tell me I'm not the only one who's done this 💀"
- "Drop the stock ticker you wish you'd analyzed first"
- Reply strategy: Show empathy for similar stories in comments

CTA:
"Don't be me" (protective, humble, relatable)

POSTING STRATEGY:
- **Best timing**: During market volatility (red days, sector crashes)
- **Trigger event**: When major indexes drop 2%+ (everyone feeling pain)
- **Hashtags**: #Investing #StockMarket #PanicSell #TradingMistakes #BloomAI
- **Platform**: TikTok + Instagram Reels (relatable mistake format works on both)
- **Series potential**: "Stocks I wish I'd checked first" (weekly regret series)

FOLLOW-UP CONTENT IDEAS:
1. "Here are 5 stocks I DID check with Bloom AI before buying (saved me $8K)"
2. "Analyzing the stock I panic-sold. Was I actually wrong?"
3. "The exact checklist I use now before buying anything"
4. "Red flags I'll never ignore again after this mistake"
5. "Update: That stock I panic-sold? Yeah, it recovered. I'm even more sick now."
6. "Showing you exactly how to avoid being me (step-by-step)"

WHY THIS HOOK WORKS:
- **Relatable pain point**: Everyone's panic-sold or made a regrettable trade
- **Timing irony**: "JUST found this" implies bad luck/timing (creates sympathy)
- **Specific loss amount**: -30% and $2,400 (concrete, believable)
- **Discovery format**: Casual stumble onto solution (not researched, just found)
- **Self-deprecating**: Viewer feels superior ("I wouldn't make that mistake") but empathetic
- **FOMO reversal**: "This existed the whole time" = missed opportunity regret
- **Prevention angle**: "Check this BEFORE you buy" (future-focused, not dwelling on past)
- **Triple question marks**: Communicates genuine shock and disbelief
- **Bridge to product**: Organic discovery after pain point (not forced)

UGC SCRIPT ANALYSIS:
✓ User is hero (creator is the cautionary tale)
✓ Problem from creator's POV ("I panic-sold", not "tools lack data")
✓ Organic bridge to product (friend sent it, relatable discovery)
✓ Benefits through feelings ("I'm genuinely upset I didn't know")
✓ Soft CTA ("Don't be me" not "Download now!")

AUTHENTICITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Use real portfolio screenshot (or clearly mark as example)
- If using real trade: Show actual ticker, dates, prices
- If simulated: Clearly state "Example scenario" in production notes
- Never fabricate specific loss amounts without proof
