TEXT OVERLAYS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
→ "I copied Pelosi's trades for 6 months"
→ "Result: -8% (while she was +32%)"
→ "The problem: 45-day reporting delay"
→ "By the time you see it, you're late"

SCRIPT / VOICEOVER:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[0-3s] HOOK:
"I followed Nancy Pelosi's stock trades for 6 months. She made 32%. I lost 8%.
Here's why copying politicians doesn't work."

[3-20s] THE PROBLEM:
"Politicians have 45 days to report their trades. By the time you see what they
bought, the stock's already moved. She bought NVDA at $420. You see the filing
6 weeks later at $520. You buy at $520. It drops to $480. She's up 24%. You're
down 8%. You're always late."

[20-45s] WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS:
"Don't copy the trades. Track the PATTERN. What sectors are they buying? Tech,
defense, pharma? What's the timing? Before hearings? After bills? That's the
edge. Bloom AI tracks these patterns across all of Congress. It finds the
strategy, not just the delayed trades."

[45-60s] THE INSIGHT + CTA:
"Pelosi's edge isn't the stocks she picks. It's the information she has BEFORE
she picks them. Bloom AI finds those same sectors, same catalysts, same setups
— in real-time. No 45-day delay. Try Bloom AI free — link in bio."

VISUALS:
• Frame 1: Side-by-side of Pelosi vs creator's portfolio results
• Frame 2: Timeline showing 45-day gap with price movement
• Frame 3: Pattern analysis dashboard (sectors, timing, catalysts)
• Frame 4: Bloom AI real-time alerts vs delayed filings

MUSIC: Investigative/analytical tone

TEXT STYLE:
• Timeline showing "Trade date" vs "Filing date" vs "Your buy date"
• Price charts highlighting the gap
• Green for Pelosi's returns, red for retail's
• Animated calendar showing 45-day delay

VARIATIONS TO TEST:
• Other politicians (Crenshaw, Ocasio-Cortez)
• "I tested every Congress tracker app"
• "The ONE metric that predicts Congress trades"
• Series: Weekly Congress pattern analysis

CTA: "Get ahead of the trades — link in bio"

POSTING STRATEGY:
• Controversial topic = high engagement
• Educational angle (expose the flaw)
• Use #Congress #Pelosi #StockMarket
• Pin comment: Legal disclaimer
• Expect political debate (good for algo)
