[0-3s] HOOK:
"If you own any of these five stocks, we need to talk."

[3-20s] SETUP - THE LIST:
"Number one: [STOCK1 NAME]. Number two: [STOCK2 NAME]. Three: [STOCK3 NAME].
Four: [STOCK4 NAME]. And five: [STOCK5 NAME].

I'm not here to tell you what to do with your money—but I just ran all five of these
through Bloom AI, and here's what came back."

[20-35s] REVEAL - THE DATA:
"Every single one? Flagged as overvalued or showing sell signals.

[STOCK1] is trading at a P/E ratio way above sector average. [STOCK2] missed earnings
three quarters in a row. [STOCK3] has insider selling activity spiking. This isn't opinion—
this is data."

[35-45s] RESULTS + CTA:
"Look, I'm not saying panic sell everything. But if you own any of these, at least check
what Bloom AI says about your specific holdings.

Run your portfolio through it. Link in bio."

PRODUCTION NOTES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

VISUALS:
- Frame 1: Direct-to-camera, serious tone (like a concerned friend)
- Frame 2: Clean list format, stocks appear sequentially with warning symbols
- Frame 3: Actual Bloom AI screenshots showing sell/overvalued ratings
- Frame 4: Portfolio analysis view demonstrating the feature
- Use real stock tickers that are currently popular/hyped but showing warning signs
- Color coding: Red for overvalued, yellow for caution, brief green contrast for "safe" alternative mention

MUSIC:
- Minimal or no music in opening (0-3s) to emphasize seriousness
- Subtle tension-building track (3-20s) as list builds
- Data-focused, analytical tone (20-35s) during reveal
- Slightly reassuring but urgent (35-45s) for CTA

TEXT STYLE:
- "We need to talk" appears bold, centered, serious font
- Stock tickers in large, readable font with warning symbols (⚠️)
- Sequential numbering (1-5) for clear structure
- "ALL OVERVALUED" in red, capitalized for emphasis
- CTA arrow (👇) pointing to link direction

AUTHENTICITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Use REAL stocks with actual concerning metrics
- Show genuine Bloom AI analysis screenshots
- Cite specific data points (P/E ratios, earnings misses, insider activity)
- Include dates and current prices
- Disclaimer: "Not financial advice. Do your own research."
- If a stock rebounds after posting, create follow-up explaining why valuation concerns persist

TONE CALIBRATION:
- **NOT panic-inducing**: "Look, I'm not saying panic sell..."
- **NOT arrogant**: "I'm not here to tell you what to do..."
- **IS concerned**: "We need to talk"
- **IS data-driven**: "This isn't opinion—this is data"
- **IS protective**: Friend warning you, not guru preaching at you

ENGAGEMENT DRIVERS:
1. **Personal Relevance**: "If you own these..." = viewer checks their portfolio
2. **List Format**: Numbered structure creates completion desire (must see all 5)
3. **Controversy Magnet**: Calling out specific popular stocks = passionate defenders commenting
4. **FOMO + Fear**: Combined urgency (miss opportunity + avoid loss)
5. **Data Authority**: Not opinions, showing actual metrics
6. **Protective Framing**: Positioned as helping, not selling

VARIATIONS TO TEST:

1. **Hook variations**:
   - "If you own [STOCK1], we need to talk" (single stock focus)
   - "These 5 stocks are about to hurt you" (more aggressive)
   - "I just checked these 5 stocks—you need to see this" (discovery angle)
   - "Everyone owns these, but look at the data..." (contrarian angle)

2. **Stock selection strategies**:
   - **Hyped stocks**: Reddit/Twitter trending tickers with weak fundamentals
   - **Meme stocks**: Popular retail holdings showing deterioration
   - **Sector-specific**: "If you own these tech stocks..." "If you own these EV stocks..."
   - **Price point**: "5 stocks over $100 that are overvalued"
   - **Thematic**: "5 AI stocks that aren't what they seem"

3. **List length variations**:
   - 3 stocks (shorter, punchier—20-30s format)
   - 5 stocks (standard—30-45s)
   - 7 stocks (comprehensive—45-60s)
   - Top 10 (long-form—60-90s)

4. **Reveal format variations**:
   - Show all 5 upfront, then dive into data
   - Reveal one at a time with suspense
   - "Guess which one is the worst" interactive format
   - Before/after format (what they think vs. what data shows)

5. **Urgency levels**:
   - **Low**: "Worth checking out"
   - **Medium**: "We need to talk" (current)
   - **High**: "Urgent: These stocks are red flags"

CONTROVERSY LEVEL: HIGH
- Directly calling out specific popular stocks = defensive bag-holders
- High engagement through debate: "You're wrong about [STOCK]!"
- Risk: If stocks rally short-term, credibility questioned
- Mitigation: Focus on valuation metrics, not price predictions
- Opportunity: Passionate comments boost algorithm

FOLLOW-UP CONTENT IDEAS:
1. "I said [STOCK] was overvalued—here's what happened" (30-day follow-up)
2. "5 stocks you SHOULD own right now" (positive counterbalance)
3. Response video: "Everyone's defending [STOCK], here's more data..."
4. "How to spot overvalued stocks yourself" (educational)
5. "I ran the S&P 500 through Bloom AI—here are the worst" (expanded version)
6. "What bag-holders taught me about confirmation bias"
7. Viewer-requested: "Check my portfolio" series
8. Monthly series: "5 stocks to avoid this month"

CTA OPTIMIZATION:

**Primary CTA**: "Run your portfolio through Bloom AI. Link in bio."
- Action-oriented (run/check)
- Personal (your portfolio)
- Low friction (just click link)

**Secondary CTAs** (pinned comment):
- "Drop your ticker, I'll run it through Bloom AI"
- "Comment your biggest holding—let's check it together"
- "Which stock surprised you most?"

**Engagement Bait**:
- "If you own [STOCK1], comment your average price"
- "Defend your position—I'm genuinely curious"
- "What stocks would you add to this list?"

POSTING STRATEGY:

**Timing**:
- **Optimal**: Sunday evening (7-9pm) before market open
- **Alternative**: Wednesday mid-week during trading hours
- **Avoid**: Right after major positive news for mentioned stocks
- **Strategic**: After a hyped stock's major run-up (peak attention)

**Hashtags** (pick 4-6):
- #StockMarket #Investing #BloomAI
- #[STOCK1] #[STOCK2] #[STOCK3] (ticker tags for discoverability)
- #OvervaluedStocks #StockAnalysis
- #InvestingTips #PortfolioCheck

**Platform-Specific Adjustments**:
- **TikTok**: Faster pacing, more dramatic music
- **Instagram Reels**: Cleaner aesthetic, less urgent tone
- **YouTube Shorts**: Longer pauses for retention, "pin this" prompts

**Cross-Promotion**:
- Link to expanded YouTube video: "Full analysis of all 5 stocks"
- Newsletter sign-up: "Get weekly overvalued stock alerts"
- Community discussion: "Join our Discord to discuss"

**Risk Management**:
- Monitor comments for 24-48 hours post-posting
- Prepare data-driven responses to common objections
- If stock rallies, post follow-up: "Why valuation still matters despite price increase"
- Balance with positive content (don't only post negative)
- Always include: "Not financial advice, for educational purposes only"

CONTENT-TO-PRODUCT MAPPING:

**Primary Feature Showcase**:
- **Valuation Analysis**: P/E ratios, price targets, fair value calculations
- **Sell Signals**: Automated rating system (Buy/Hold/Sell)
- **Risk Scoring**: Overall risk assessment per stock
- **Portfolio Scanning**: Ability to analyze multiple holdings at once

**Value Propositions Highlighted**:
1. **Protection**: "Catch overvaluations before they hurt you"
2. **Data Advantage**: "See what institutions see"
3. **Time Savings**: "5 seconds vs. hours of research"
4. **Objectivity**: "Remove emotional attachment, see the data"

**Differentiation from Competitors**:
- Not generic advice: "Your specific stocks"
- Real-time data: "Current valuations, not outdated info"
- Transparent methodology: "Here's WHY it's overvalued"
- Actionable: Not just alerts, but what to do next

TARGET AUDIENCE SPECIFICITY:

**PRIMARY**: Retail investors who:
- Own popular/hyped stocks (meme stocks, Tesla, Nvidia, etc.)
- Bought during hype cycles or based on social media
- Are starting to feel uncertain about their holdings
- Want validation or challenge for their positions
- Have been holding through losses (bag-holders with confirmation bias)
- Follow finance content but lack tools for analysis

**SECONDARY**: Active traders who:
- Day trade or swing trade popular tickers
- Need quick valuation checks before entry/exit
- Want contrarian indicators (what's overhyped)
- Appreciate data-driven controversy

**TERTIARY**: Financial learners who:
- Want to understand valuation concepts (P/E, fundamentals)
- Learn through real examples of overvaluation
- Are building investing framework
- Don't own these stocks yet but researching them

PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS:

1. **Loss Aversion**: "Protect what you have"
2. **Confirmation Seeking**: Viewers want to prove you wrong OR right (both engage)
3. **Social Proof**: "Everyone owns these" = relevance
4. **Authority**: Data-backed claims > opinions
5. **Urgency**: "Need to talk NOW"
6. **Pattern Recognition**: Teach them to spot danger themselves

SENTENCE-LEVEL RETENTION:

✓ "If you own any of these five stocks" — Immediate self-filtering (is this me?)
✓ "we need to talk" — Personal, urgent, serious
✓ "Number one: [STOCK]" — Promises structure, specific info incoming
✓ "I'm not here to tell you what to do" — Disarms defensiveness
✓ "I just ran all five through Bloom AI" — Establishes methodology
✓ "and here's what came back" — Curiosity gap (what did it say?)
✓ "Every single one? Flagged." — Pattern reveal (bigger than one stock)
✓ "[STOCK] is trading at P/E ratio way above average" — Specific, technical credibility
✓ "This isn't opinion—this is data" — Authority statement
✓ "I'm not saying panic sell everything" — Prevents tune-out from defensive viewers
✓ "But if you own any of these, at least check" — Reasonable ask, low barrier

MULTI-HOOK LAYERING:

- **Visual Hook**: Serious direct-to-camera expression (body language says "important")
- **Spoken Hook**: "We need to talk" (relationship urgency trigger)
- **Text Hook**: Stock tickers appearing (scannable, specific)
- **Curiosity Hook**: "Which 5 stocks?" (if thumbnail doesn't reveal all)
- **List Hook**: Numbered format (completion desire)
- **Data Hook**: "Bloom AI flagged all of them" (what did it find?)
- **Authority Hook**: Specific metrics cited (P/E, earnings, insider activity)
- **FOMO Hook**: "You might own these" (personal relevance check)
- **Protective Hook**: Friend warning you (not attacking you)

DROP-OFF MITIGATION:

- **0-3s**: Immediate personal relevance check ("If you own...")
- **5-8s**: "Number one" begins list (structure established, expectations set)
- **10-12s**: "Number three" (halfway through list, maintain momentum)
- **15s**: Transition: "I just ran these through Bloom AI" (new information coming)
- **20s**: "Every single one? Flagged." (pattern reveal, stakes raised)
- **25s**: Specific data points (P/E, earnings misses) — keep analytical viewers engaged
- **30s**: "This isn't opinion—this is data" (reinforce credibility at potential exit point)
- **35s**: "I'm not saying panic sell" (re-engage defensive viewers who might leave)
- **40s**: Clear CTA with low barrier ("just check it")

VISUAL RHYTHM:

- **0-3s**: Static shot (establish seriousness)
- **3-5s**: Cut to stock ticker #1 appearing
- **5-7s**: Ticker #2 (change every 2s)
- **7-9s**: Ticker #3

AUTHENTICITY & CREDIBILITY SAFEGUARDS:

**Data Requirements**:

- Use actual Bloom AI screenshots, not mockups
