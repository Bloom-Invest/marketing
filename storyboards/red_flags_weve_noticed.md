TEXT OVERLAYS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
→ "🚩 RED FLAGS THIS WEEK"
→ "[STOCK1] 🚨" → "CEO sold $50M in shares"
→ "[STOCK2] ⚠️" → "Debt-to-equity ratio spiking"
→ "[STOCK3] 📉" → "Revenue down 3 quarters straight"
→ "Bloom AI caught all of these"
→ "Get weekly alerts 👇"

SCRIPT / VOICEOVER:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[0-3s] HOOK:
"Red flags we've noticed this week—and you probably missed them."

[3-15s] SETUP - RAPID-FIRE FORMAT:
"Number one: [STOCK1 NAME]. The CEO just sold fifty million dollars in shares.
Not a good sign when leadership is bailing.

Number two: [STOCK2 NAME]. Their debt-to-equity ratio is spiking—this company is
becoming a liability risk.

Number three: [STOCK3 NAME]. Revenue declining for three quarters straight.
That's not a dip, that's a trend."

[15-35s] REVEAL - THE PATTERN:
"Here's what's crazy—these stocks are all trending on social media right now.
Thousands of retail investors are buying in without seeing these red flags.

Bloom AI flagged every single one of these automatically. Insider trading activity,
balance sheet warnings, revenue trends—it's all there in real-time."

[35-45s] RESULTS + CTA:
"This is what hedge funds have been watching for years. Now you can too.

Get weekly red flag alerts before you buy. Link in bio."

PRODUCTION NOTES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

VISUALS:
- Red flag emoji as dominant visual element (Frame 1)
- Use actual Bloom AI screenshots showing red flag alerts
- Data visualizations for each warning sign (debt charts, revenue trends, insider activity)
- Stock ticker symbols displayed prominently with warning symbols
- Split-screen or rapid transitions between three stocks
- Final frame shows Bloom dashboard with all flags visible

MUSIC:
- Alert/warning sound effect at start (0-1s)
- Tense, urgent background music during setup (3-15s)
- Slightly relieving tone when introducing solution (15-35s)
- Confident, protective tone for CTA (35-45s)

TEXT STYLE:
- Large red flag emoji (🚩) in Frame 1
- Warning symbols (🚨 ⚠️ 📉) paired with each stock ticker
- Bold white text with red highlighting for key numbers ($50M, debt ratio, 3 quarters)
- Animated checkmarks or red X's appearing as flags are mentioned
- CTA text with arrow pointing down (👇)

AUTHENTICITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Use REAL stock examples with actual recent insider selling, debt issues, or revenue declines
- Show actual dates and figures from real data
- If using Bloom AI screenshots, must be genuine analysis from the platform
- Verify all claims are factually accurate and current
- Include disclaimer if needed: "Not financial advice, for educational purposes"

ENGAGEMENT DRIVERS:
1. **Pattern Recognition**: Teaches viewers to spot warning signs independently
2. **FOMO Prevention**: "Don't be the one who missed these red flags"
3. **Authority Positioning**: "What hedge funds watch"
4. **Timely Relevance**: Weekly format keeps content fresh and trending
5. **Shareability**: People will tag friends who own these stocks
6. **Series Habit**: Weekly cadence creates return viewership

VARIATIONS TO TEST:
1. **Hook variations**:
   - "Three stocks you should NOT buy this week 🚩"
   - "These red flags will save you thousands 🚨"
   - "Everyone's buying these—here's why they shouldn't"

2. **Stock selection strategies**:
   - Trending tickers on WSB/FinTwit
   - Stocks with recent price spikes (hype buying)
   - Meme stocks with deteriorating fundamentals
   - Sector-specific (tech red flags, energy red flags)

3. **Format variations**:
   - 3 stocks (standard)
   - 5 stocks (rapid-fire)
   - Single stock deep-dive (when major red flags emerge)
   - "Green flags vs Red flags" comparison format

4. **Educational depth**:
   - Basic version: Just state the flags
   - Advanced version: Explain WHY each flag matters
   - Data-heavy version: Show specific metrics and thresholds

CONTROVERSY LEVEL: MEDIUM-HIGH
- Calling out specific stocks as risky = controversial but educational
- Creates debate in comments (defenders vs. skeptics)
- Risk: If stock performs well short-term, viewers may criticize
- Mitigation: Focus on risk factors, not price predictions

FOLLOW-UP CONTENT IDEAS:
1. "We warned you about [STOCK]—here's what happened" (results tracking)
2. "How to spot red flags yourself" (educational breakdown)
3. Response videos to comment questions about specific stocks
4. "Green flags we're seeing" (positive counterbalance)
5. "Red flags that turned out to be nothing" (intellectual honesty)
6. Sector-specific red flag series (tech, healthcare, energy)

CTA OPTIMIZATION:
- Primary: "Link in bio for weekly red flag alerts"
- Secondary (pinned comment): "Drop any ticker, I'll check for red flags"
- Engagement bait: "Which stock surprised you most? 👇"
- Series reminder: "Follow for weekly red flag updates"

POSTING STRATEGY:

**Timing**:
- Post Sunday evening (7-9pm) for Monday market prep
- Alternative: Friday after market close (weekend research time)
- Avoid posting during major market events (Fed announcements, earnings)

**Hashtags** (pick 4-5):
- #StockMarket #RedFlags #BloomAI
- #Investing #StockAnalysis #MarketWarning
- #RetailInvestor #StockNews
- Trending stock tickers: #[STOCK1] #[STOCK2]

**Series Branding**:
- Consistent opening: "Red flags we've noticed..."
- Weekly numbering in title (optional): "Red Flags #1", "Red Flags #2"
- Recurring visual style (red theme, same text treatment)
- Predictable format = habit formation

**Engagement Strategy**:
- Pin comment asking: "What stock should I analyze next?"
- Reply to defensive comments with data, not arguments
- Create poll: "Which red flag is most concerning?"
- Tag relevant investing communities
- Cross-post to other platforms with slight adjustments

**Risk Management**:
- Always include: "Not financial advice, do your own research"
- Focus on risk factors, not price predictions
- If stock rebounds, post follow-up explaining why risk factors still matter
- Balance negative flags with occasional positive analysis

CONTENT-TO-PRODUCT MAPPING:
- **Primary Feature**: Red flag detection system
- **Value Prop**: Early warning system for retail investors
- **Differentiation**: Real-time insider activity, balance sheet monitoring
- **Authority**: "What institutions watch" positioning
- **Habit Formation**: Weekly check-in creates routine usage
- **Social Proof**: "Caught all three" demonstrates reliability

TARGET AUDIENCE SPECIFICITY:
PRIMARY: Retail investors who:
- Are actively buying individual stocks (not just index funds)
- Have been burned by social media hype stocks
- Feel information disadvantage vs. institutions
- Want to learn risk assessment but don't have time for deep research
- Follow stock-related social media accounts

SECONDARY: Financial learners who:
- Want to understand fundamental analysis
- Are building investing knowledge
- Appreciate educational content with real examples
- May not be active investors yet but aspire to be

SENTENCE-LEVEL RETENTION:
✓ "Red flags we've noticed this week" — Promises immediate value
✓ "and you probably missed them" — Creates curiosity gap
✓ "Number one: [STOCK]" — Specific, structured delivery
✓ "The CEO just sold fifty million dollars" — Concrete, alarming data
✓ "Not a good sign when leadership is bailing" — Explains significance
✓ "Number two..." — Maintains momentum, promises more
✓ "Here's what's crazy" — Pattern interrupt, raises stakes
✓ "These stocks are all trending on social media" — Relevance spike
✓ "Bloom AI flagged every single one" — Solution reveal
✓ "This is what hedge funds have been watching" — Authority + democratization

MULTI-HOOK LAYERING:
- **Visual Hook**: Red flag emoji (immediate pattern recognition)
- **Spoken Hook**: "Red flags we've noticed" (promise of insider info)
- **Text Hook**: "$50M" and specific numbers (scannable value)
- **Curiosity Hook**: "You probably missed them" (information gap)
- **Authority Hook**: "What hedge funds watch" (insider access)
- **FOMO Hook**: "Thousands are buying these" (protective urgency)
- **Story Hook**: Three-part structure (numbered progression)

DROP-OFF MITIGATION:
- 0-3s: Urgent visual + pattern interrupt hook
- 5-10s: "Number two" creates expectation of three-part structure
- 15s: "Here's what's crazy" — injects new tension at potential drop point
- 25s: Solution reveal (Bloom AI) — reward for staying
- 35s: CTA positioned after value delivery, not before
- Throughout: Rapid pacing (no sentence longer than 7 seconds)

VISUAL RHYTHM:
- Change every 2-3 seconds: stock ticker → data viz → warning symbol
- Text overlays appear/disappear in sync with voiceover
- Red color theme maintained throughout (brand consistency)
- Final frame (Bloom dashboard) acts as visual payoff

SERIES LONGEVITY:
- Infinite content potential (new red flags every week)
- Built-in tracking mechanism (can revisit stocks in future episodes)
- Seasonal variations (tax season red flags, earnings season red flags)
- Skill progression (basic → advanced red flags over time)
- Community participation (viewer-submitted tickers to analyze)
