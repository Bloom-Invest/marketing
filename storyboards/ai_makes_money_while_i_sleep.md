SCRIPT / VOICEOVER:

[0-3s] HOOK:
"This AI makes money while I do literally nothing. I didn't even wake up yet, and my portfolio was up $340 this morning."

[3-20s] SETUP:
"Here's the thing—I used to spend 3 hours every night researching stocks. Reading Reddit threads, watching YouTube breakdowns, checking news... exhausting. Now? I spend 5 minutes. Because I built an AI system that does ALL of that for me, automatically."

[20-45s] REVEAL:
"Every single morning before the market opens, Bloom AI has already scanned over 500 stocks, flagged the red flags, spotted the catalysts, and ranked the top 3 plays for the day. I wake up to a notification that says 'Here are today's best opportunities'—with the analysis already done. Real-time data. Institutional-level research. Zero effort from me."

[45-60s] RESULTS + CTA:
"In the last 30 days? Up $4,200. While I went to the gym, hung out with friends, actually lived my life. The AI never sleeps, never misses a beat, never gets tired. If you're still doing manual research in 2025, you're working 100x harder for the same result. Link in bio—try it free."

PRODUCTION NOTES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

VISUALS:
- Frame 1: Authentic bedroom/morning vibe, natural lighting, phone screen clearly showing green gains
- Frame 2: Dynamic split-screen with smooth transition, emphasize the contrast (stress vs ease)
- Frame 3: Screen recording of actual Bloom AI interface—must be REAL app footage
- Frame 4: Portfolio performance chart (use real data if available, clearly mark if simulated)
- Throughout: Smooth transitions, professional but relatable aesthetic (not over-produced)

MUSIC:
- Start: Soft, curious ambient (waking up vibe)
- 10s mark: Build to upbeat, confident electronic (productivity/tech feel)
- 40s mark: Peak energy, inspiring/victorious
- Fade out at CTA with notification "ding" sound

TEXT STYLE:
- Bold sans-serif font (Montserrat or similar)
- Green for wins/automation benefits, Red for old way/manual work
- Animated counters for "500+ stocks" (rapid counting effect)
- Checkmarks ✓ appear with subtle pop animation
- Numbers grow/scale in for emphasis (+$4,200 should pulse)
- Notification overlay looks like actual phone notification

AUTHENTICITY REQUIREMENTS:
⚠ MUST show real Bloom AI interface—no mockups
⚠ Portfolio gains must be real OR clearly labeled "simulated results"
⚠ Include disclaimer: "Results shown are from actual account over 30 days. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results."
⚠ Timestamp visible on morning notification to prove "before wake up" claim

ENGAGEMENT DRIVERS:
✓ Passive income angle (massive appeal)
✓ Time saved (3 hours → 5 minutes = 36x efficiency)
✓ Specific results ($4,200 in 30 days = credibility)
✓ Relatable problem (exhaustion from manual research)
✓ FOMO trigger (others automating while you work hard)
✓ Lifestyle benefit (gym, friends, living life)

VARIATIONS TO TEST:

VERSION A - Different Hook:
"I made $340 before I even brushed my teeth this morning."

VERSION B - Different Time Period:
"$12,400 in 90 days" (longer tracking period)

VERSION C - Different Pain Point:
"I used to stay up until midnight reading stock news. Not anymore."

VERSION D - Different Proof Point:
"73% win rate. The AI hasn't missed in 3 weeks."

VERSION E - More Controversial:
"Hedge funds automated this 10 years ago. You're just catching up now."

SERIES POTENTIAL:
- "Day 1 vs Day 30" progress tracking
- "AI picked this, I would've never seen it" (specific stock stories)
- Weekly update series: "This week the AI made me..."
- Response video: "You asked how it works, here's the full breakdown"
- "5 stocks the AI flagged this week" (recurring format)

CTA VARIATIONS:
- "Link in bio—try it free"
- "Stop working harder. Link in bio."
- "The AI is free to try. Link in bio."
- "See what it picks for you. Link in bio."

POSTING STRATEGY:
- **Best Time**: Sunday 7-9pm (Monday prep mindset) OR Wednesday 6-8am (mid-week motivation)
- **Hashtags**: #PassiveIncome #AIInvesting #StockMarket #BloomAI #AutomatedInvesting
- **Caption**: "I automated my stock research and got my life back. Here's the system 🧵"
- **Pin Comment**: "Drop a 💰 if you're tired of spending hours on research"
- **Engagement Bait**: Reply to comments with "Try [specific ticker], see what the AI says"

CONTROVERSY LEVEL: MEDIUM-HIGH
- Claim: Passive income through AI (some will challenge)
- Defense: Show real results, real interface, real process
- Builds debate: "Can AI really replace research?" (YES—drives comments)

FOLLOW-UP CONTENT IDEAS:
1. "The 3 red flags the AI caught that I would've missed"
2. "Here's what the AI picked this morning" (daily series)
3. "My manual research vs AI research: side-by-side results"
4. "The stock the AI warned me about—it crashed 2 days later"
5. "How I set up the automation (full tutorial)"
6. "30-day results reveal: Every single trade"
7. "What happens when the AI is WRONG" (transparency builds trust)
8. "The morning routine of someone who doesn't do stock research"

TARGET AUDIENCE:
- Primary: 25-40 year old retail investors, currently doing manual research, time-starved
- Secondary: Crypto/trading enthusiasts interested in automation
- Tertiary: Passive income seekers, side hustle community

EXPECTED PERFORMANCE:
- Views: 1.5M-5M (passive income + automation = highly shareable)
- Engagement Rate: 8-12% (controversial claim drives comments)
- Saves: High (aspirational content, people want to revisit)
- Shares: Very High (friends tagging friends: "We need this")

RISK MITIGATION:
- Include compliance disclaimer about investment risks
- Never say "guaranteed" or "can't lose"
- Show both wins AND mention that losses happen
- Emphasize "tool for research" not "automatic money printer"
- Transparency = trust = long-term audience
