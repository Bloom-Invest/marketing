SCRIPT / VOICEOVER:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[0-3s] HOOK:
"I built a stock trader with Claude AI and it's scary good. Like, I'm a little nervous about how accurate it is."

[3-20s] SETUP:
"Here's what I did. Day one, I opened Claude and gave it one prompt: 'Build me a system that analyzes stocks like a hedge fund would—find the red flags, spot catalysts early, and rank opportunities by risk-reward.' 30 minutes later, I had a working AI analyst."

[20-45s] REVEAL:
"Then I tested it. And this is where it got scary. It caught 7 red flags on stocks I was about to buy—debt issues, insider selling, weak earnings—stuff I completely missed. It spotted a Tesla catalyst 2 hours before I even saw the news. And get this: it flagged a fraud stock as 'high risk, avoid' three days before it crashed 60%. How?"

[45-60s] RESULTS + CTA:
"45 days in: 11 winning trades, 2 losers, 84% accuracy. Up $6,800. The craziest part? Anyone can build this. You don't need to code, you don't need a finance degree. You just need Claude and the right prompts. Link in bio—I'll show you exactly how I did it."

PRODUCTION NOTES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

VISUALS:
- Frame 1: Clean desk setup, laptop showing actual Claude interface (claude.ai)
- Frame 2: Screen recording of REAL conversation with Claude—show actual prompts and responses
  * Must look authentic (actual Claude UI, not mockup)
  * Typing effect can be sped up but should feel real
  * Show the "thinking" animation Claude does
- Frame 3: Bloom AI interface showing real analysis results (red flags, catalyst detection)
  * Use actual stock examples (Tesla, real fraud case if available)
  * Split screen shows manual investor would miss these
- Frame 4: Real portfolio performance graph (or clearly labeled simulation)
  * Show individual trades, not just total
  * Timestamp/date stamps visible for authenticity

MUSIC:
- 0-10s: Curious, experimental (building something new)
- 10-30s: Building tension, mysterious (discovering power)
- 30-45s: Slightly ominous/intense (the "scary" realization)
- 45-60s: Confident, powerful resolution
- End with subtle "whoosh" sound effect on final numbers

TEXT STYLE:
- Modern sans-serif (Inter or SF Pro)
- Typewriter effect for Claude prompts (authentic coding/AI vibe)
- Red warning symbols (⚠) that pop in with alert sound
- Green checkmarks for wins
- Scoreboard-style reveal for final stats (11-2-84%)
- Numbers should have slight glow effect (tech aesthetic)

AUTHENTICITY REQUIREMENTS:
⚠ MUST show real Claude.ai interface—actual conversation
⚠ Prompts shown must be real prompts that work
⚠ Stock examples must be real (Tesla catalyst = actual news event)
⚠ Performance numbers: real OR clearly labeled "simulated backtest"
⚠ Include disclaimer: "Results based on 45-day test period. AI provides analysis, not financial advice."
⚠ Show actual Bloom AI output, not generic "AI" mockups

ENGAGEMENT DRIVERS:
✓ "I built this" = empowerment angle (you can do this too)
✓ Specific tool named (Claude = credible, searchable)
✓ "Scary good" = intrigue + performance implication
✓ Concrete examples (caught fraud before crash = wow factor)
✓ Exact win rate (84% = specific, believable, not too perfect)
✓ Accessible ("anyone can build this" = democratic)
✓ Time efficiency (30 minutes to build)

VIRAL FORMULA USED:
✓ Builder/Maker Narrative (empowering, aspirational)
✓ Specific Tool Tutorial (Claude = everyone has access)
✓ Shocking Performance (84%, caught fraud, beat human)
✓ Mystery/Intrigue ("how did it know?")
✓ Democratic Access ("you don't need to code")

VARIATIONS TO TEST:

VERSION A - More Dramatic Hook:
"This AI predicted a stock crash 3 days early. I built it in 30 minutes."

VERSION B - Different Results Frame:
"$12,400 in 90 days, 11/13 trades won" (longer period, different ratio)

VERSION C - Educational Angle:
"I asked Claude to think like a hedge fund. Here's what it taught me."

VERSION D - Challenge Frame:
"I challenged Claude to beat my stock picks. It's not even close."

VERSION E - Specific Stock Focus:
"This AI spotted the Tesla catalyst 2 hours before Wall Street. Here's how."

VERSION F - Fear/Caution Hook:
"I'm genuinely worried about how good this AI is at trading stocks."

SERIES POTENTIAL:
- "Part 1: The Prompt That Started It All" (full tutorial)
- "Part 2: The First Time It Saved Me From a Bad Trade"
- "Part 3: When It Caught the Fraud Stock" (detailed story)
- "Part 4: 90-Day Update—Still Working"
- "The Exact Prompts I Use" (high-value, gated content)
- "Claude vs My Manual Research: 30-Day Challenge"
- Weekly: "This Week's AI Picks" (ongoing series)
- "Build Your Own AI Trader (Full Tutorial)"

CTA VARIATIONS:
- "Link in bio—I'll show you how to build it"
- "Want the exact prompts? Link in bio"
- "Build your own. Link in bio for the guide"
- "Try it yourself—link in bio"

POSTING STRATEGY:

**Best Time**:
- Tuesday/Wednesday 6-9pm (mid-week, after-work tech discovery)
- Sunday 5-8pm (weekend project inspiration)

**Hashtags** (Pick 3-5):
- #ClaudeAI #AITrading #StockMarket #BloomAI #BuildInPublic
- #AITools #FinTech #PassiveIncome #TechTok #InvestingTips

**Caption**:
"I gave Claude AI one prompt and built a stock trader that's 84% accurate. This is wild 🤯"

**Pin Comment**:
"Reply with 💰 if you want the full tutorial on how I built this"
OR
"Drop any stock ticker—I'll run it through the AI and show you what it finds"

**Engagement Bait**:
- Ask: "What would you name your AI trader?"
- Challenge: "Give me a stock to analyze—AI vs your intuition"
- Poll: "Would you trust an AI with your investments? Yes or No"
- Request: "Should I share the exact prompts?"

CONTROVERSY LEVEL: HIGH
- Claim: "Built AI trader, 84% win rate" (will attract skeptics)
- Defense: Show real trades, real process, real Claude conversations
- Expected Pushback: "You can't predict stocks", "This is cherry-picked"
- Counter: "It's not predicting—it's analyzing data humans miss. Here are all 13 trades."
- Builds Debate: "Can anyone really build this?" → YES, massive engagement
