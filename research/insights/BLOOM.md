# About Bloom
Investing feels like gambling for most people. Most people don’t have the time, attention, temperament, or expertise to research stocks and choose the best ones. Even after buying, it takes time, energy, and emotional anxiety to watch your portfolio and keep up with 24/7 news cycles.

Bloom is investing on autopilot. It’s professional-grade portfolio management with hedge fund level research. Let AI do the hard work and read thousands of earnings calls, financial statements, and news items. 
- Deeply researched stock portfolios — “Wow this research is incredible, I understand exactly why this could be a good trade, it’s like a hedge fund is helping me manage my money.”
- Automatic portfolio adjustments – “It’s reacting to information I would have missed, protecting my money”
- Daily curated market updates – “I know exactly what is happening on the stock market without needing to do homework”
- Answers to any investing question – “I feel like I’m in good hands and can do my own verification when I need to”

# Target Audience:
- Anyone who is interested in learning more about investing in stocks, or people who want to use AI for their investments but don’t know how (“curious claire”)

- Robinhood investors (“gambling greg”)
