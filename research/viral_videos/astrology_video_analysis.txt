This is going to be the spiciest month of 2025.

You are not walking through this month the same way you entered it.

Let me explain all the crazy, intense, emotional,

exciting, and surprising things happening in your love life in November

based on your zodiac sign.

I'm also commenting exactly what you need to hear

in the month of November based on your sign.

But you must be following me to bring those comments to the top.

Mercury retrograde is starting in the beginning of November

and staying retrograde for the entire month.

It is bringing back more than one ex?

Yes, more than one,

including ex friends. See if they are karmic versus soulmate

only on the star crossed app.

Because

karmic people are destroying the healthy boundaries you've created,

creating chaos in your love life.

I want you to make sure that you see their karmic versus soulmate

on Starcross. So I linked it in my bio for you to download.

Aries, November 2025 is a portal for you.

November 5th is the Taurus full moon,

and it's hitting your second house of money.

Plus, it's conjunct Jupiter,

the planet of blessings, blessing your bank account.

But it's also making you reflect.

If your love life is reflecting these blessings,

you're gonna be confronted with a situation where you've been under

choosing, settling,

overgiving

a partner or a situationship is either stepping up or running away.

There is no middle ground.

You might be the one to choose to Walk away.

November 6th. Venus enters Scorpio.
