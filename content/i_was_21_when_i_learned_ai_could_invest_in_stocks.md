TEXT OVERLAYS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
→ "I was 21 when I learned AI could pick stocks"
→ "Before: Hours of research, random picks, losses"
→ "After: AI does research, data-driven picks, +47% YTD"
→ "2 years later: $2,400 → $31,200"
→ "Wish I'd started at 18"

[0-3s] HOOK:
"I was 21 years old when I learned AI could invest in stocks for me. I wish
someone had told me sooner."

[3-20s] BEFORE AI:
"Before that, I was doing everything wrong. Spending hours on Reddit reading
'DD.' Buying stocks because they had cool names. Panic-selling when things
dropped. I turned $2,400 into $1,900 in 6 months. I was terrible at this."

[20-45s] AFTER AI:
"Then I found Bloom AI. It scans thousands of stocks in seconds. Finds
undervalued plays. Checks fundamentals, technicals, sentiment — everything I
should've been doing. I started following its picks. Within 6 months: +28%.
One year: +47%. Two years: $2,400 turned into $31,200."

[45-60s] REGRET + CTA:
"I'm 23 now. If I'd known about this at 18, I'd have 5 years of compound growth.
Don't make my mistake. Start now. Try Bloom AI free — link in bio."

PRODUCTION NOTES:

VISUALS:
• Frame 1: Young person looking shocked/amazed (relatable Gen Z energy)
• Frame 2: Screenshots of messy research tabs, Reddit posts, losing trades
• Frame 3: Clean Bloom AI interface, winning trades, growth chart
• Frame 4: Timeline showing age 21→23 with portfolio growth visualization

MUSIC: Nostalgic/reflective at start, uplifting/hopeful at end

TEXT STYLE:
• Handwritten-style font for "I was 21" (personal touch)
• Red for losses, green for gains
• Timeline animation showing years passing
• Large dollar amounts in bold

VARIATIONS TO TEST:
• "I'm 19 and already using AI"
• "Started at 25, wish I started at 20"
• "Told my little brother about this"
• Different age groups (18, 25, 30)

CTA: "Don't wait. Start today — link in bio"

POSTING STRATEGY:
• Target younger audience (18-25 demo)
• Use #GenZ #Investing #FinancialFreedom
• Post on Sunday evening (planning week ahead)
• Pin comment: "When did YOU start investing?"
