TEXT OVERLAYS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
→ "ChatGPT will confidently give you wrong advice"
→ "Asked 'Is COIN a buy?' → 'YES, strong buy'"
→ "Reality: COIN down 40% since that advice"
→ "It can't access real data. It just guesses."
→ "Don't trust AI that can't show its work"

SCRIPT / VOICEOVER:

[0-3s] HOOK:
"ChatGPT will confidently give you wrong stock advice. And you'd never know.
That's the problem."

[3-20s] REAL EXAMPLE:
"I asked ChatGPT: 'Is Coinbase a good buy?' It said YES. Quote: 'Strong
fundamentals, growing user base, crypto adoption is rising. I'd recommend
buying.' Sounded smart. Sounded confident. I checked the stock. Down 40% since
that recommendation. It gave me advice that would've lost me thousands. With
complete confidence."

[20-45s] WHY IT'S DANGEROUS:
"Here's the scary part: ChatGPT can't access real financial data. It doesn't
check earnings reports. Doesn't verify SEC filings. Doesn't know current market
conditions. It guesses based on training data from 9 months ago. It doesn't
fact-check itself. It doesn't know when it's wrong. And it speaks with the same
confidence whether it's right or hallucinating."

[45-60s] THE SOLUTION + CTA:
"Bloom AI is different. It pulls live data feeds. Shows you the sources. Updates
every minute. Checks actual earnings, actual valuations, actual technicals. When
it's uncertain, it says so. Your money deserves better than AI guesses. Use AI
that shows its work. Try Bloom AI — link in bio."

VISUALS:
• Frame 1: Caution/warning signs, red alerts
• Frame 2: ChatGPT conversation showing confident (but wrong) advice
• Frame 3: Behind-the-scenes showing what ChatGPT can't access
• Frame 4: Bloom AI dashboard with live data sources and citations

MUSIC: Suspenseful → alarming → reassuring resolution

TEXT STYLE:
• ChatGPT quote in large confident font
• Reality check in red with -40% loss
• "HALLUCINATED" in warning colors
• Bloom features with green checkmarks and "VERIFIED" labels

CHATGPT CONVERSATION TO SHOW:
User: "Is COIN (Coinbase) a good buy right now?"

ChatGPT: "Coinbase (COIN) presents an interesting investment opportunity. Here's
my analysis:

✓ Strong fundamentals in the crypto exchange space
✓ Growing user base as crypto adoption increases
✓ Diversifying revenue streams beyond trading fees
✓ Strategic positioning for institutional crypto adoption

Given these factors, COIN could be a solid long-term buy for investors bullish
on cryptocurrency adoption."

REALITY CHECK TO SHOW:
• COIN price chart: Recommendation date → 40% decline
• Missing information ChatGPT didn't check:
  ✗ Q3 earnings: -75% revenue YoY
  ✗ Trading volume: Down 60%
  ✗ User growth: Stagnant
  ✗ Valuation: 45x forward P/E (sector avg: 18x)
  ✗ Technical: Broken support, downtrend confirmed

BLOOM COMPARISON TO SHOW:
Same query in Bloom AI:

"Analyze COIN for me"

Results:
⚠ COIN - SELL RATING (3.2/10)
• Price: $85.40
• Fair Value: $58 (47% overvalued)
• Revenue: -75% YoY ⚠
• Trading volume declining
• Technical: Downtrend, RSI 32 (oversold but no reversal)
• Risk: High (8.4/10)

Sources: [Yahoo Finance] [SEC EDGAR] [TradingView]

Recommendation: AVOID - Wait for stabilization

SPECIFIC DANGERS TO HIGHLIGHT:
• "Sounds confident" = Not the same as "Is accurate"
• AI hallucinations in finance cost real money
• No accountability when ChatGPT is wrong
• Can't distinguish good advice from bad without verification

BLOOM'S TRANSPARENCY TO SHOW:
• Every metric has a source link
• Live timestamp on all data
• Confidence score on recommendations
• "Data last updated: 2 minutes ago"
• When uncertain: "Insufficient data to rate" (honest)

VARIATIONS TO TEST:
• "ChatGPT told me to buy these 5 stocks. Here's what happened."
• "AI hallucinations cost me $12,000"
• "The stock advice ChatGPT shouldn't be giving"
• Series: "I tested ChatGPT stock picks for 30 days"

FEAR-BASED MESSAGING (ETHICAL):
• Not fear-mongering, but legitimate safety concern
• Position as financial protection
• Build trust through transparency
• Educate on AI limitations

AUTHENTICITY REQUIREMENTS:
• Use real ChatGPT conversation (screenshot with timestamp)
• Use real stock performance data
• Don't fabricate or exaggerate
• Show actual price charts
• Demonstrate Bloom's source citations

ENGAGEMENT BAIT:
• "Have you lost money on ChatGPT stock picks?"
• "ChatGPT investors, check your returns"
• "AI hallucinations are real. Here's proof."

FOLLOW-UP CONTENT IDEAS:
• "I asked ChatGPT about 20 stocks. Here's how many it got wrong."
• "The worst ChatGPT stock advice I've seen"
• "When ChatGPT admits it doesn't know"
• "How to fact-check AI investing advice"

CTA: "Don't trust AI that can't show its work — link in bio"

POSTING STRATEGY:
• Post during volatile market day (relevance)
• Use #AIHallucination #ChatGPT #InvestingWarning #StockMarket
• Pin safety-focused comment with examples
• Position as public service / investor protection

VIRAL POTENTIAL: EXTREMELY HIGH (Fear + Specific example + Safety concern +
Controversy + Protects viewers' money)
