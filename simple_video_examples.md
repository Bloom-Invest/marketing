**Time to make: 7 minutes | Equipment: Screen recording + screenshots**

### What You'll Say:
```
"Most investors do this:

→ Google the stock
→ Read some Reddit posts
→ Watch a YouTube video
→ Buy

Here's what hedge funds do:

→ Analyze 10-Ks
→ Model cash flows
→ Track insider trades
→ Monitor 13Fs
→ Compare to peers

You don't have time for that.

Bloom AI does all of this in 3 seconds.

Link in bio for free research."

### How to Make It:
1. Create two columns in Canva: "Retail Investor" vs "Hedge Fund"
2. List bad habits on left (Reddit, hype, no research)
3. List pro habits on right (10-Ks, models, insider data)
4. Show Bloom AI dashboard as the solution
5. Optional: Screen record yourself using Bloom AI
6. Post with hashtags: #StockResearch #InvestingTips #HedgeFunds #BloomAI #DYOR

**Why it works**: Contrast. Shows the gap between amateurs and pros. Positions Bloom AI as the bridge.
